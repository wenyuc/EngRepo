For cities around the world, China's booming tourist industry offers enormous commercial opportunity. Already China sends more travelers abroad than any other country, and there's huge room for further growth: only about 4% of Chinese citizens hold passports, compared to 35% in the U.S.
Chinese tourists spent $215 billion abroad last year, 53% more than in 2014, according to a report from the World Travel & Tourism Council. Goldman Sachs estimates that figure will surge to $450 billion by 2025.

in China to start producing EVs by 2019. Officials have also said they are working on a plan to ban gasoline cars.

Hefner indeed was a pioneer. He was the force behind the mainstream objectification of women, someone who paid them to take their clothes off and convinced them it was empowering to do so, using the same arguments pronographers use for the same goals.

- I have to praise him for his savvy when he created his business. His 'inventory' and concept were as simple as showing beautiful women and inviting curiosity of sex. He built an empire and lived a good life. Smart man. 

Szechuan sauce

Back in 1998, McDonald's released its limited-edition version of Szechuan sauce - a hot-and-spicy condiment that adds a balaced kick to various dishes - as part of a promotional campaign for the animated film "Mulan".

Fast forward to the 21st century, and another animated character comes into play. In the TV series "Rick and Morty", Rick becomes obsessed with the McDonald's Szechuan sauce. Even the astute marketer, McDonald's last week broght back packets of the sauce for a limited time, in small quantities, and in only a small percentage of its restaurants.

McDonald's was skewered on social media by frustrated customers who had hoped to score some of its limited edition Szechuan sauce but were instead turned away and left empty-handed.

Mcdonald's Name in China
Fox News
McDonald's has officially changed its company name to "Golden Arches" in China.
According to CNN Money, the global fast food chain is changing from Maidanglao, meaning McDonald's, to Jingongmen, roughly translated to the china's nickname "Golden Arches".
Though the change from iconic McDonald's would seem like a huge deal, "the name change only applies to the china's business registration," a spokeperson told CNN Money. The "restaurant's branding will stay the same" and likely not have any major effect on the company's business.

水逆
水星逆行，Mercury Retrograde。
不再指某一段时期，而是成为大家遇事不顺的常用词。Mercury is about to retrograde again!
事实上，水星逆行并非水星的实际运行方向反向，而是由于水星运行轨道与地球自转带来的黄道角差而带来的视觉上的轨迹改变。因为水星是距离太阳最近的行星，所以运行轨道比地球短得多，运行周期也快。
Mercury doesn't actually move backward. If you do a bit of stargazing, you will see that Mercury appears to move backward. After a while, - in Mercury's case, a three-and-a-half-week period - the planet will reverse itself and move "forward" again. Because Mercury is the planet situated closest to the Sun, its orbit is much shorter than Earth's.

Beauty standards for a lot of Asians are so frustrating. 

Some Chinese beauty standards are inspired by Western looks, but others definitely remain typically Oriental. White skin is one of them and is a must have in China.

The white skin ideal can certainly be the weirdest Chinese beauty standard for westerners as they prefer being tanned than as pale as white jade.

Chinese think that girls with big eyes are the most beautiful, even more so if their eyes have a double-fold eyelid. 

Lots of westerners view Lu Yan as a super beauty, maybe because of her typical oriental looks. She looks exotic, and exotism often appeals, as it's new and different.

The worst face shape a Chinese girl can have according to Chinese beauty standards, is a square face. A square face is considered very manly.

As for westerners, their ideal face shape is kind of differnet. Even if the oval-shaped face is very popular, according to a survey, the most attractive face for a girl is ... the square face.

A beauty is a woman you notice, a charmer is one who notices you.

Cranberry's popularity in China

and toss them into smoothies and baked goods believing they are healthful and unique. Their

It's that time of the year again. China's - and the world's - biggest online shopping event is about to take place on 11 November. Known as Singles' Day, Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, transformed the de facto holiday from an 'anti-Valentine's Day' for Chinese singletons to a global shopping festival back in 2009 - and made billions of dollars in the process.

China's richest man Jack Ma, 53, has just become the country's hottest Kung Fu star.

The e-commerce billionaire, worth $37.4 billion, has starred in a new martial arts film in which he beats a series of famous Kung Fu actors, with his favourite martial arts style, Tai Chi.

The star-studded Kung Fu comedy is produced by Mr Ma's company, Alibaba Group, and is being streamed online and released in cinemas in major Chinese cities.

THe company makes almost all its money from e-commerce, which was underscored by the $25 billion in sales on Singles Day on Nov 11.

But Mr. Ma has a grand vision that Alibaba's future hings on its ability to compete in double "H" industries -health and happiness - and he sees entertainment as a key component in the latter.

But its efforts so fare are like an untalented rich kid trying to break into Hollywood.

The assets it acquired in film, and online video and music are shrinking or losing market share to rivals including Tencent Holdings Ltd.

One reason: Alibaba doesn't have entertainment in its DNA. Its executive ranks lack the talent needed to lead creative endeavors that are fundamentally different from its core e-commerce business.
